# Nodes and properties
The scene explorer contains a hierarchy of nodes. When selecting a node the node properties will show up in the properties window. Hover over a property field to see description.  

To add a node, right - click the desired parent node in the scene explorer and choose a type under "New"  

If a property is not explicitly given, the inherited value will be used (purple). If there is no inherited value, the default value will be used (gray).  

For inherited property values, see group node
