# Scene
This is the root node for each level. It is mostly used to configure the shadow volume size. A level can only have one scene node.  

Keep the shadow volume as small as possible since it consumes a lot of video RAM. In order to work on AMD graphics cards, the shadow volume has to be kept below 400 meters in any direction.
