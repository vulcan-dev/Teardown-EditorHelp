# General
The teardown editor is used in combination with MagicaVoxel to create content for Teardown.

The scene explorer on the left shows the scene structure, while the graphical 3D view gives a visual representation. When selecting an object in the scene explorer, the corresponding object will be highlighted in the 3D view and vice versa.
