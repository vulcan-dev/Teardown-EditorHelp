# Instance
Instances are used to place predefined groups of content (prefabs) into the scene. This is useful to place multiple instances of complex objects into the scene. Changing the prefab will affect all instances.

Prefabs are created from groups. To create a prefab, right click a group in scene explorer and select "Create new prefab...".

If you want to make modifications to a prefab, right-click an instance in scene explorer and select "Convert to group". This will make a local, editable copy of the instance. When you are done editing you right click the group and select "Commit to prefab". This action saves the prefab and updates all instances.
